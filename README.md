Implement all the requirements into features and connect the application to the API. We create a buyer and seller page. Buyer can find the vacant land by knowing the strategic distance from the point of interest. Sellers can sell their vacant land easily by posting their vacant land in the application. Also implement a map for searching a land through the google maps.
